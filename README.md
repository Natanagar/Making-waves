# Test task for Making waves
Make an audio player using html and Vanilla JS/TypeScript (TS will be a plus). The player should play your favorite free music and contain at least functionalities like play, stop and music visualizer (using the html canvas element). It doesnâ€™t have to be a very fancy player. 
We will evaluate your player in terms of the architectural solution, performance, and readability. Build system will be a plus. Use your imagination and have fun!
